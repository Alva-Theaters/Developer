# Alva Developer
Makes it easier to manage many text blocks.

Intended for developers working on the soon to be released v2.0 of Alva Sorcerer if they don't use an external IDE like VS Code. This does basically the same thing as the built-in drop-down enumerator for text blocks in the text editor, but it uses template_list instead. It also has a button for running all selected scripts at once. It makes working with 7+ scripts much more pleasant.
